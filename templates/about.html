    <h2>How did the name "NoExcuse" start?</h2>
    <p>While building the website, I came up with the name NoExcuse because I believe perservernce is the key in fitness. 
        I also believe that excuses also grow like habits, and I do because I have an experience of this before. Because I 
        wanted to remined people who are making excuses because they don't want to exercise, I decidede to name the site "NoExcuse".
