    <p>I first started my workout through a School Health Program. During PE class, we had this workout challenge 
    developing different parts of body which I think that needs development. I downloaded a squat challenge from the 
    google play, and proceeded on the challenge without a rest. First day, I did not manage to do many squats. 
    It also gave me some pains in my legs that gve me some inconviniences while walking to school. 
    I did the challenge everyday, which would increses the amount of squats everyday even though
    my legs felt like they would snap. But once the challenge was over, I was totally satisfied at how much muscles that I 
    have developed. With the support of developed leg muscles, it made me feel lighter in everyday walking. This allowed
    me to run further, and faster in a school cross counrty. After experiencing the positive affects of fitness, 
    I decided to develope other parts of my bodies too, starting from arms, abs to back.</p>

    <h2>Perseverance is the key</h2>

    <p>Ofcourse I had the days that I really didn't want to workout, days that I become more lazy and tired. 
    But overcoming those days really gave me triumph of overcoming myself. </p>

    <p>Perseverance is really important in fitness, and it probably is important in many other things including study
    or other diciplines. Overcoming process is meant to be hard, otherwise everybody will be fit, smart, and will be 
    good at everything. But at the end of the process, you will be able to find yourself smiling. Don't try to make excuses!
    No excuses are not accepted unless you are in a condition where rest is required for healing from a injury.</p>
